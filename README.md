*Fluordynamics* simplifies the workflow of setting up, running and evaluating Molecular dynamics simulations with extrinsic organic fluorophores for *in silico* FRET experiments.

### Interactive fragment generation

The Python module allows to build new fragments (base, linker and dye) **interactively**. It integrates into PyMOL such that the molecular viewer can be controlled directly from a **Jupyter notebook**. The module also features a dedicated **PyMOL plugin** called *Fluorlabel* to attach the new fragments to a nucleic acid of interest with the click of a button.

### Patching AMBER force fields

Using established pipelines for topology generation such as *Antechamber* and *Acpype*, Fluordynamics builds on top of the AMBERDYES package (Graen et al. *JCTC* 2014) and extends the force field with parameters of common **nucleic acid** linker chemistries.

### *in silico* FRET prediction

MD trajectories with all-atom organic dyes are used to as distance and orientation distributions (:math:`R_\text{DA}` and :math:`\kappa^2`) to compute photon bursts as part of an *in silico* FRET experiment.
